Questions
How do we only allow one button click per tile? 
HTML/CSS
Conditional rendering
Is it an X in the square or a O
Who wins? X or O or also if the Cat

Atoms
Tiles
Using bootstrap on a div to make it .col-4

Div.container
	Div.row
		div.col-4

Organism
Tiles - click events
Board as whole
Buttons (restart)


Objectives
The game should let the players know who's turn it is.
Player x or player O
Remove EventListeners
Game tiles should only be clickable once
if the game is over they should not be clickable at all.
The game should display who wins the game if someone wins, otherwise, say that the game resulted in a tie.
There should be a Restart Game button that does not refresh the page (set state).
On each player’s turn, that player places one of their symbols on an unoccupied space by clicking.
The game continues until one player places three symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and wins or there are no remaining available spaces and it is a draw.
Only have a single <div id="app"></div> in your index.HTML (try to code golf the HTML file)
